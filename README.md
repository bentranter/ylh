# `ylh`: The site formerly known as yearlonghackathon.com

The home of the yearlonghackthon.com site.

In my final year of university, I decided to do a "year long hackathon", where every week I'd hack together some project. I think I did for about six weeks before getting overwhelmed by work, school, and this project, but it did lead to me getting a 500 day commit streak, and my first decent job.

This project is no longer active, but I'll leave this up for awhile until my new site is ready _(edit: it's ready at [bentranter.io](https://bentranter.io))_. Thanks to anyone who might've read these articles!
