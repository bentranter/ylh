          <section class="content"><p><strong>The Problem</strong>: I like making things but I’m too scared to ship them. The solution? I force myself to ship new stuff on a weekly basis for an entire year, and write about it.<span class="more"></span></p>
<p>As long as I’ve been programming (which is around three years as of writing), I’ve always been making things. Most things have been pretty lame and broken, but the creative process is the main reason I like programming. Its like playing with lego, except you can’t step on a program and cut your foot open (at least not&nbsp;literally).</p>
<p>One thing I’ve always struggled with is shipping. Out of all the things I’ve made, I’ve never had the confidence to actually release them out into the world. The point of this project is for me to force myself to become better at shipping, as well as to give me platform to share all the dumb stuff I’ve made with the&nbsp;world.</p>
<p><strong>Every Sunday of this year, I’ll be releasing a project (either new, or a significant iteration) along with some words about how it was&nbsp;created.</strong></p>
<p>I was always fascinated by hackathons. Its pretty crazy what people are capable of creating in a short period of time. Its also pretty crazy how long it can take for devs to release or update software. I’ve been on both sides: I’ve participated in hackathons, and created something non-trivial in less than a full weekend’s time, and I’ve failed to complete a todo app over the course of a month. I’ve basically decided that the only way to become truly efficient at creating and shipping code, is to practice that exact&nbsp;thing.</p>
<p>The code, website, and everything that makes up this project will be publicly available on <a href="https://github.com/bentranter">GitHub</a>. Besides this project, I’m also a third year student at Lakehead University in Computer Science, and a part time front-end developer at <a href="http://boltmedia.ca/">Bolt Media</a>. If you’re interested in keeping up with me elsewhere, I’m on <a href="https://twitter.com/0xBen">Twitter</a>, and do all my non-techinical writing on <a href="https://medium.com/@0xben">Medium</a>.</p>
<p>I guess I should end by making a note of my intentions to do at least a few projects that don’t involve JavaScript, if only for my own accountability :) I’m sorry to everyone who dislikes the language, and I’ll admit it has an impressive amount of flaws. However, once you step into the community, you’ll never want to leave. Its the&nbsp;best!</p>
