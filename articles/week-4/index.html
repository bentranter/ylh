          <h6 class="article-subtitle-article-view">Skip photoshop altogether</h6>
          <section class="content"><p><strong>The problem</strong>: You need to design something that clicks and can be moved, or in my case, you don’t want to pay for an Adobe Creative Cloud subscription when you’re pretty fast at <span class="caps">HTML</span> and CSS.<span class="more"></span></p>
<h4 id="-continuous-design-">“Continuous&nbsp;Design”</h4>
<p>Lately I’ve been fascinated by designers who skip Photoshop, Sketch, or any other design tools, and go straight to the browser. The earliest I heard of this was back in 2008 in <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1061-why-we-skip-photoshop">an old Signal vs. Noise blog post</a>. Since then, I’ve heard of people being faster with <span class="caps">HTML</span> and CSS than in Photoshop (see <a href="http://mrmrs.cc/">mrmrs</a>. I figured it was time I give it a&nbsp;try.</p>
<p>Obviously if you’re a designer who always designs in the browser, developers are going to love you. There’s no question about what happens when you hover over something, click a link, or perform some other action if you’ve designed in the browser. There’s no guessing padding, margins, border-radiuses, or any other layout elements. It’s easy to tell what the mobile layouts look like because you’ve already created them (if you’re not doing responsive design by default in 2015 then wtf???) Best of all, it prevents you from mocking up stuff in Photoshop that is next to impossible to efficiently recreate in a&nbsp;browser.</p>
<h4 id="startup-auto-signup-whatever">Startup-Auto-Signup-Whatever</h4>
<p>I find myself signing up for random stuff on Product Hunt pretty often, and half the time I don’t even really read what the product is. I just sign up and await their initial email (or launch email if they haven’t launched yet). I figured a lot of people probably do this, which got me thinking: what if there was a service where you paid a set amount of money a month, and were automatically signed up for the latest, most popular startups? You could pick your interests, choose how much you’re willing to spend, and then just sit back and wait for an email that tells you what you’ve signed up for, while some algorithm curates startups for you. It’s like <a href="https://www.lootcrate.com/">Lootcrate</a> for tech and startup enthusiasts. Startup creators would also love it because it’d gurantee them a few users no matter what when they&nbsp;launched.</p>
<p>Initially it seems like a good idea, but after thinking about it for awhile it seemed kinda shitty. Either way, I was still gonna mock it up for fun. I decided to mockup the welcome page, signup process, and home screen. I chose <a href="http://code.kik.com/app/2/index.html">App.js</a> and <a href="http://tachyons.io/">Tachyons</a> initially for development, but ended up not using Tachyons for this because of the learning curve. I would really like to try it again as it seems pretty&nbsp;cool.</p>
<p>I was hoping it would take me an hour and a half, but it ended up taking about four and a half hours. That’s quite a bit longer than it would’ve taken me in Sketch, but you gotta start somewhere. You can see it in action at <a href="http://yearlonghackathon.com/demos/autosignup/">yearlonghackathon/demos/autosignup</a>. Use Chrome or Firefox’s mobile emulator, look at it on a phone, or at the very least shrink your browser window down for the best&nbsp;experience.</p>
<p>I know I’m a bit off-schedule with the posts, but my next post should make up for that. It’s about creating <span class="caps">REST</span> APIs with Express and RethinkDB, and consuming them with Ampersand.js. I think it’ll be pretty cool, so watch for that around next Tuesday or&nbsp;so.</p>
